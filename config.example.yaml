# PDF Redaction Configuration
# Exceptions to the default behavior (case-insensitive substring matching)

# Redaction settings
redaction:
  # Default behavior: "none" or "all"
  # - "none": Redact nothing by default, exceptions list specifies what TO redact
  # - "all": Redact everything by default, exceptions list specifies what to KEEP
  default: "none"

  # Color as RGB values (0.0 to 1.0) or hex string
  # Examples: [0, 0, 0] for black, [1, 1, 1] for white, "#FF0000" for red
  color: "#808080"

  # Also redact the exchange rate line below matching transactions
  include_exchange_rate: true

# Exceptions to the default behavior
# When default is "none": these terms trigger redaction
# When default is "all": these terms are kept visible (not redacted)
exceptions:
  # Add terms to match (case-insensitive substring matching)
  # Examples:
  - "EXAMPLE_VENDOR"
  - "SAMPLE_MERCHANT"
  # - "YOUR_TERM_HERE"

# Exact match exceptions (for short terms that could cause false positives)
# These match the description field exactly (case-insensitive)
exact_match:
  # - "XX"  # Use for short terms that might match unintended text
